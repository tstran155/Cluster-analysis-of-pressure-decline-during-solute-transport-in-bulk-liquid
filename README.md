Pressure decline data from high temperature and high pressure tests of gas transport into the oil phase is often analyzed and divided into three regions, representing different fluid transport mechanisms. The clustering of these regions -early-time, transition and late-time regions- is typically based on changes in slopes of pressure with time. For further details on the context of the experiment and dataset used in this notebook, please refer to my Ph.D. dissertation.

This notebook presents two unsupervised machine learning algorthims namely K-Means and K-Plane to cluster the pressure decline vs. time data. The structure of the Jupyter Notebook is as follow:

1. Prepare problem
a) Load libraries
b) Load dataset

2. Dataset summary
a) Descriptive statistics
b) Data visualizations

3. Evaluate and compare algorithms
a) K-Plane clustering
b) K-Means clustering

4. Conclusions
